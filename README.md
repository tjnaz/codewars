# Codewars Kata Solutions 🥋

Hey there, fellow coder! 👋 Welcome to my Codewars Kata Solutions repository. This is where I store my solutions to challenges from [Codewars](https://codewars.com). You know, just flexing my coding muscles and building good habits. 💪

## Directory Structure 📁

My solutions are organized by difficulty levels, from 1kyu (hardest) to 8kyu (easiest). Each level has its own folder, so it's easy to navigate. Happy browsing!

## Disclaimer ⚠️

These are **my own** solutions, and I'm sharing them to commit to learning publicly and maintain the discipline of coding consistently. Please don't use them to cheat on challenges! Remember, the real gain comes from working through the problems yourself. 😉

## Advice for Beginners 🌱

If you're just starting with coding challenges, here's some advice to help you out:

1. **Be patient:** Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your coding skills. It takes time and practice, so keep at it!
2. **Learn from others:** Check out other people's solutions after you've completed a challenge. There's always something new to learn!
3. **Don't give up:** Some challenges might seem impossible at first, but with persistence, you'll crack them. Remember, every coder was once a beginner.
